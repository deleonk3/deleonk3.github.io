Browser History 1
For this WOD I learned how to develop a webpage using basic HTML. On my first attempt I was able to complete the WOD within standard time. Linking the table of contents to the designated section within the web page was the task I found to be the most challenging. Since I got on suck on this part I looked at the screencast video and followed the instructions. I realized that the mistake that I kept on making was that I did not insert a hashtag before stating which section of the webpage I wanted to link to. 
After attempting this WOD four times I was able to complete Browser History 1 within Rx time. 
My advice is that before attempting Browser History 1, first make sure that you read all of the required readings and do the practice html questions found on w3schools.com. Once you are familiar with the material then attempt doing the WOD. If you still get stuck I recommend watching the screencast. However, simply watching the screencast will not get you the results you desire. While wathcing the screencast make sure you are trying each step on your own as well. Consistenly practicing each section of the WOD helped me a lot. 

Browser History 2 
For browser history 2 I learned how to style a webpage by using CSS and Google web fonts. This WOD waS difficult for me mostly because I am not very familiar with CSS or Google web fonts. My first attempt at the WOD I DNF'd. It took me 4 more attempts to complete the assignment within Rx time. 
My advice to anyone struggling with CSS is to read and undersatnd the subject more. To improve my skills in CSS I watched and attempted practice tutorials for CSS. Once I understood the different tags associated with CSS and unserstood each of their functions, CSS became easier for me to grasp. However, I am not completly comfortable with CSS and intend to practice it more throughout the semester. 

Browser History 3 
For this WOD I learned how to develop a webpage using chrome developer tools. Out of all of the WODS, Browser History 3 took me the longest to complete. I had no idea how to start off Browser History 3. I DNf'd twice and on my third attempt I was able to complete the assignment within Av time. Since I had no idea how to start off this WOD I went staright to the screencast and followed the instructions and worked through each problem. Simply watching the video was not enough for me so I made sure to practice each section multiple times. 
My advice is to watch the screencast and work through it, don't just watch it.
