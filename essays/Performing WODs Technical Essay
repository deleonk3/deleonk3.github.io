Invoice2 
In invoice 2 our task was to modify the sales reciept that we worked on for Invoice 1. We had to add a new section labled shipping, and we had to calculate new varibales for shipping.
For the most part I found this WOD to be fairly simple. Most of it was self explanitory and the directions were easy to follow.  The only part where I struggled was setting up the if statements. I didn't know the correct verbage I had to use until viewing the screencast.
To improve my skill and knowlege on if statements I beleive that I need to practice more and re read the sections that explain how to set up if statements.
