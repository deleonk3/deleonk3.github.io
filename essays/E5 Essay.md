Assignment 2 focused on building both a login page for our and a registritaion page for our ecommerce website. We had to build our website in a way where 
all the information that was inserted in our products page would be saved through our login page and shown in our invoice. More details about the assignment 
are provided in this link https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/modules/Assignment2/. What I learned from this assignment as well as Lab 14, is how to build a longin 
and registraition page. I also learned how to create a query string to transfer saved information from one page to another. I did not get help from a partener. Whenever 
I felt stuck going back and reviewing the labs helped a lot. If I was still stuck on something I would either google what problem I was having or used youtube. The task I found 
most challenging about this assignment was transfering the information from my products page to th login page to the invoice. Transfering info from the proucts page to the inovice page was no 
problem. Not losing that information on the login page was challanging. This assignment was different than assignment one becasue most of the work I did revolved around the server. I felt like in 
assignment one most of the focus was on displaying your products. I would say 50% of my time was spent thinking about doing something for this assignment. I found myslef thinking about ways I could
improve my code constantly. I would say 25% of my time was spent writing code and 25% of my time was spent testing my code and debugging. Creating my login page and registration page was easy. However, 
transferung data from one page to the other was not. If I could go back and change things I would probably spend more time learning about query strings and how I can use them to transfer data between pages.
