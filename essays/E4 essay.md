title: Progress in Programming Report

Now that we are almost at the end of the semester I can confidently say that my programming skills have greatly improved.
Before taking ITM 352 I had no basic understanding of programming. I must admit, at first I was little intimidated from this class.
I thought that no matter what I did I would never fully grasp the concept of programming. However as the semester progressed I realized 
that nobody is ever perfect when it comes to programming. Now I am very enthusiastic about programing. With all of the skills that I have learned, 
I'm even more excited to learn new skills in programming. Learning how to build my own website and server was such a cool experience and has insipred me to 
become an exceptional programmer. When it comes to the WODs I would say that I can do some, but not all without looking at the screencast solutions. I can do
WODs from module 2 to 8 without using the screencast solutions but I need more practice on the rest. In my opinion, the labs were DEFINITELY the most important 
tools I used to understand programming. Without them I would be completely lost. Each lab took me a couple of times to complelte to understand exactly why they were
assigned and to understand the importance of them. I not only feel ready but also excited to move onto the next stage of programming. I think the class is very well stuctured 
and my only complaint is that we didn't have more in person classes due to the COVID-19 virus.
